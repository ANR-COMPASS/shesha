#  COMPASS: End-to-end AO simulation tool using GPU acceleration
#  The COMPASS platform was designed to meet the need of high-performance for the simulation of AO systems.
#
#  The final product includes a software package for simulating all the critical subcomponents of AO,
#  particularly in the context of the ELT and a real-time core based on several control approaches,
#  with performances consistent with its integration into an instrument. Taking advantage of the specific
#  hardware architecture of the GPU, the COMPASS tool allows to achieve adequate execution speeds to
#  conduct large simulation campaigns called to the ELT.
#
#  The COMPASS platform can be used to carry a wide variety of simulations to both testspecific components
#  of AO of the E-ELT (such as wavefront analysis device with a pyramid or elongated Laser star), and
#  various systems configurations such as multi-conjugate AO.

script test to simulate a closed loop

Usage:
  closed_loop.py <parameters_filename> [options]

with 'parameters_filename' the path to the parameters file

Options:
  -h --help          Show this help message and exit
  --brahma           Distribute data with BRAHMA
  --bench            For a timed call
  -i, --interactive  keep the script interactive
  -d, --devices devices      Specify the devices
  -n, --niter niter  Number of iterations
  --DB               Use database to skip init phase
  -g, --generic      Use generic controller
  -f, --fast         Compute PSF only during monitoring
